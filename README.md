# ClosureJS

-> closure basically means that a function bundled together with its lexical environment is called closure. 
i.e function along with lexical function called closure.

OR

-> function along with it lexical scope bundle together forms closure.

## Advantage/Uses of closure :-
(We are not going deep into uses of closure)

-> Module Design Pattern 

-> Carrying 

-> Function like once 

-> Memoize 

-> Maintaining State in Async World

-> SetTimeouts

-> Iterators etc.

## Example of data privacy in closure :- 
-> Suppose if we have a variable and we want to have some data privacy over it, 
other function or other piece of code, cannot have access to that particular data.

## Disadvantage of closure :- 
-> The variable declared inside a closure are not garbage collector .
Too many closure can slow down your application .

## Garbage Collector :- 
-> Some High-Level language, Such as Javascript, utilize a form of automatic memory management known as garbage collector .

-> In simple way, the purpose of a garbage collector is to monitor memory allocation and determine when a block of allocated memory 
is no longer needed and reclaim it.
